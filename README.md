# nh3-syn-reactor
1D Pseudo-Homogeneous PFR Chemical Reactor for Ammonia Synthesis.

## Getting Started

This repo contains an all-in-one Jupyter Notebook as the main source file for simulation of a fixed bed reactor for ammonia synthesis. The simulation file contains thermodynamic properties, chemical kinetics and industrial catalyst data from available scientific literature (cited therein).

### Prerequisites

To implement the program, a standard Python 3 installation with Jupyter is sufficient.

## Deployment

The solver can be deployed within any OS that supports Jupyter Notebooks, and virtually to any machine that support the former tools. 

## Contributing and Improvements

*Contributing and redistributing the code is free!*

You may choose to modify and improve it to your liking.
